There is a global config file called config.py, and the master's ip address is stored in this file.
Be sure to change the master's ip address in this configuration file before you start to run any python file.
You may also want to change the OUTPUT_DIR in config.py file.

1.Master
python master_server.py

2.Worker
python worker_server.py worker_ip_address

3.Client
python client.py <Sorting|WordCount> input_file split_size num_of_reducers output_file_basename
example:
    python client.py Sorting sort.txt 100 1 Sort
    This will run sorting operation on sort.txt file with split_size of 100 and 1 reducer, and the output file will be stored in directory specified by the OUTPUT_DIR in config.py

4.Sequential execution
python mr_seq.py <Sorting|WordCount> split_size num_of_reducers input_file output_file_basename
example:
    python mr_seq.py Sorting 100 1 sort.txt Sort
    This will run sequential sorting operation on sort.txt file with split_size of 100 and 1 reducer, and the output file will be stored in current directory

5.Collect
python mr_collect.py <Sorting|WordCount> output_file_basename
